# Evolution Timeline

*Make sure you watch Everything Is A Remix before embarking on this assignment.*

Create a timeline showing the evolution of an existing object or experience over time:
*   an infographic as a pdf (post on your process website) **OR** 
*	another video documentary 1 to 3 minutes in length, post on vimeo or youtube, and embed on your process website **OR** 
*	an interactive data visualization and embed within your process website.

The object timeline should reflect:
* an object or experience that relates to your framing story or message for your future Dystopia / Utopia project OR
* your favorite object or experience (if you are having a hard time coming up with ideas for the future dystopia / utopia project)

In other words, show the past history of an existing object or experience (as in how it evolved from when it was first made to how it is now). The timeline should contain **at least** 3 iterations if not more.
